You see a single chessboard image. Assume WHITE TO MOVE.
Return ONLY valid JSON with these keys:
- "fen64": the first FEN field (piece placement only).
- "eval_cp_white": one integer centipawn evaluation from White's perspective. Positive means White is better.

Rules:
- JSON only. No extra text.
- fen64 must use standard FEN piece letters and digit-run syntax for empty squares.
- Do not include side-to-move, castling, en passant, halfmove or fullmove fields.

Example:
{"fen64":"rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR","eval_cp_white":-15}
